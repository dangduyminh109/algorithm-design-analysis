# Algorithm Complexity Visualizer Project

This project is a Next.js application for visualizing algorithm complexity with interactive animations.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14+ with TypeScript
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- React for component architecture

## Project Structure
- Components for algorithm visualization, selection, and information display
- Algorithm implementations for sorting, searching, and extreme value finding
- Interactive UI with play/pause/reset controls and speed adjustment
- Responsive design with bubble animations for algorithm categories

## Key Features
- Interactive visualizations for sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Quick, Merge Sort)
- Search algorithm demonstrations (Linear, Binary Search)
- Extreme value finding algorithms (Linear Min/Max, Tournament Method)
- Real-time code highlighting and step-by-step execution
- Comparison mode for multiple algorithms
- Smooth animations and user-friendly interface
